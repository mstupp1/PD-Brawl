PD Brawl - Asset Directory

This directory contains all the game assets:

/images - Game graphics including card art, backgrounds, UI elements
/fonts - Custom fonts used in the game
/sounds - Sound effects and music

For the full implementation, you would need to add:

1. Card artwork for all public domain characters
2. Background images for the game board
3. UI elements (buttons, frames, icons)
4. Sound effects for card plays, attacks, etc.
5. Background music

Due to copyright considerations, no default images are included.
For development purposes, consider using placeholder graphics or 
public domain/CC0 licensed artwork.
